# Fraud Detection System

# Project Background

This project aims to train a model to detect fraudulent transaction in credit card transactions. This is built as a learning project to explore end-to-end ML workflows, from data prep and training to prediction and visualization. A use-case for this project is that it can be adapted to analyze fraud likelihood and produce insights/visuals that help interpret how much of a transaction is predicted to be fraudulent.

In this project, I built a pipeline that:

- Prepares and preprocesses data

- Trains classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest)

- Evaluates performance

- Generates predictions and visualizations

# Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline (preprocess -> train -> evaluate -> predict)

- Multiple models (baseline + tree-based)

- Clear script separation for each step
